**Before posting your problem,make sure to fully read the instructions**
1. Create a C# script named SaveGame
2. Copy and paste code.txt content
3. add new tag to objects called **"saveable"**
4. create folder Resources\Prefabs\
5. drag objects from scene(or existing prefab) to *Prefabs* folder 
(note that the ***prefab*** name should not contain parens. As example:*House (1)* or *Car(clone)* will not work)
6. Everything should work! Press 1 to save and 2 to load *(file is saved to C:\Users\username\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Project name\data.json)*
